        title1:'What is Mars Project?',
        des1:`In the process of human beings expanding interstellar boundaries, Mars has become a second home for human beings. The pioneers here have jointly established a community full of vitality and innovation (Mars Project). Community members are not lonely explorers, but partners who rely on each other and share resources. With the expansion of the community, a new economic model is also born here. Through advanced DeFi protocols and innovative dual-currency systems, every explorer is supported to gain wealth and improve themselves in this unknown land, and gain their own value on Mars. In Mars Project, every member who joins is not an ordinary "traveler", but a co-builder of Mars' prosperity. `,
        title2:'The role of FXP-X and STP-X. ',
        des2:'When you obtain computing power and activate it, Mars Project will mine FXP-X according to the value when you activate the computing power. After obtaining FXP-X, you can choose to exchange it for LP or continue to keep it in the account for STP-X mining. There are two ways to do this:<br/> 1. Exchange to LP, then withdraw LP from liquidity to get the USDT value at the time of exchange;<br/> 2. Keep it in the wallet. At this time, Mars Project will produce STP-X tokens in proportion to the value of the FXP-X you hold. Holding STP-X will compound interest at 0.4% every 8 hours, 1.2% every day, 43% a month, and 79 times a year. ',
        title3:'What should I do if the withdrawal reward is not received? ',
        des3:`This is because after you use the wallet to sign the transaction, it needs to be broadcast to the chain for block confirmation. Due to incomplete signature information or network reasons, the transaction cannot be sent to the chain normally, so there will be a situation where it is not received. If you encounter this, don't worry; after waiting for 5 minutes, the transaction will be automatically canceled, and the corresponding deducted amount will be returned to your account (address). You can also check the detailed list, find the record you operated, and then click on the [Retry] button that appears to re-initiate the transaction. `,
        title4:'What are my assets? ',
        des4:'My assets are the asset value calculated by the Mars Project DApp based on the USDT held in your wallet address, the computing power converted into USDT, and the STP-X sub-coin converted into USDT according to the USD exchange rate. All data in the DApp has been rounded to two decimal places. ',
        title5:'I made a payment, why is the data unchanged? ',
        des5:'When you encounter a payment of USDT or other interactions with on-chain contracts, but the data is still the same as before the operation, it is because the transaction you initiated has been submitted to the chain, but whether it is actually successful needs to wait for the on-chain block confirmation. Please wait a moment to check, or you can actively refresh the page to request to update the latest DApp data. ',
        title6:'Does STP-X have an ecological plan? ',
        des6:'Yes. Starship (STP) is a revolutionary token that not only represents the value of assets, but also the key to the Web3 world. In the future, the value and application potential of STP-X are immeasurable. It will be deeply integrated into the Web3 world of the 2.0 ecosystem, covering multiple frontier fields such as games, metaverse, and financial services. Its growth and development cannot be separated from the joint efforts of community members. We believe that through community collaboration and innovation, STP-X will be able to realize more ecological plans, including cooperation with mainstream exchanges to further expand its influence and recognition; and launch more mainstream trading platforms. This will bring more liquidity to STP, while also providing more convenient trading channels for investors and users around the world. ',
        title7:'Are there any rewards for inviting friends to mine?',
        des7:'Yes, inviting friends to mine will get 30% of the reward of the direct referral address. For example, if the recommended address mines 10,000 coins per day, the referral address will get 3,000 coins. '
